# Logo Generator

## Description 

Using only JavaScript, we had to create a simple SVG logo. Node.js and Inquirer were used to generate the logo.

## Installation
Node.js is required to be downloaded to use this application. Inquirer, which is in the package.json, needs to be installed to run the questions. To run any tests, Jest, also in the package.json, needs to be installed as well.

## Usage
To generate your simple logo, you need to run 'node index.js' in your terminal. You will then be prompted to answer a few questions. Upon answering all of the questions, you should receive a message stating "Created SVG file." This means that your logo was successfully created. If you receive an error, please try again.

## Credits
A few web docs were used to help generate the logo [shape](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes) and [text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Texts).
